CryptPython
A project dedicated to studying and exploring different types of cryptography algorithms.

Warning: Do not use custom-built cryptographic algorithms in production environments.

Implemented Ciphers
Caesar Cipher
Vigenère Cipher
One-Time Pad
To-Do List
Enhance data structures to enable brute-force attacks on the Vigenère cipher. Transition from using lists to dictionaries or graphs for better performance.
Implement auto-detection for more dictionaries beyond the current support of English (EN-US) and Portuguese (PT-BR).
